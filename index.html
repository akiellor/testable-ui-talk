    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>
      We wanted a <strong>friendly</strong> UI<br />
      that we could change with <strong>confidence</strong>
    </p>
  </section>
  <section class="slide" id="3">
    <h2>Our Options</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Selenium, Webdriver on a real browser (slow)</li>
      <li>Manually checking interactions (error-prone)</li>
      <li>Headless, browser emulators like envjs and htmlunit (not quite the real thing)</li>
      <li>Headless browsers like phantomjs (interesting)</li>
      <li>Decoupling from the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> and using the MVVM pattern (interesting)</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

    <h2>We Brought in KnockoutJS -- here are the pros</h2>
    <p>
      It's implementation of the MVVM pattern meant we could just right plain ol' javascript objects, which are easy to unit-test
      and don't require testing the integration with the DOM. Knockout's job is binding to the dom, which we could visually verify 
      was working correctly.
    </p>
    <p>It also meant we could use Mozilla's JS Engine Rhino for testing, since we were free of the DOM</p>

    <h2>But How?</h2>
    <p>
      Let's build a login form. We want to help our users out by not letting them click the button until both a username and password
      are present

    <h2>What's the catch?</h2>
    <p>If SEO is a concern, this approach is going to require some extra work. Google recommends having a headless browser to render your stuff
      serverside, and send the googlebot the page (grab link).</p>

    <h2>How big of a project have you tried this on?</h2>
    <p>15 months</p>
    <p>? pages, ? viewmodels, ? specs</p>
